# Manual steps

Nix-darwin goes a long way, but Apple being Apple, means that some configuration is hard to achieve. So this is a checklist for manual work to get the workstation to my desired state:

  - Grant terminal full disk access in settings.
  - Remove all shortcuts under Keyboard shortcuts in settings.
  - Import GPG key.
  - Create SCM folders.
    - Add .direnv files
